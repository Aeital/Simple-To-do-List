# Vibey To-Do App ⭐

This was my **first individual project**, created for myself to keep track of my **daily 5 main tasks**.

I wanted a simple but aesthetic to-do app, so I designed the **UI**, came up with the **app name**, **logo**, and overall vibe on my own.
Instead of checkboxes, I used **stars** to mark completed tasks to make it feel more motivating.

Built using **C++ and Raylib** as a personal learning project.
You can run by installing raylib and compiling using a C++ compiler.
Thanks for checking it out!
